# Sentiment-Analysis-with-BERT

The purpose of the project is to do sentiment analysis using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).
The dataset used is a collection of reviews of a well-known local restaurant called Paulo & Suzanne. Reviews are scraped from Yelp, and customer rating scores are ignored. The reviews are in English and French.
